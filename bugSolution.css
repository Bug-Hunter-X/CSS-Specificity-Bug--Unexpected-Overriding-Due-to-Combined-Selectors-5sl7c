The solution involves carefully refactoring the CSS to ensure the intended styles are applied.  We can achieve this by using more specific class names and avoiding the unnecessary nesting of selectors, or by using `!important` as a last resort. Here's an improved version:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

#id .container {
  width: 50%;
}

.special-container {
  width: 75%;
}

.special-container #id {
  width: 25%;
}
```

This revised version clearly separates the styles for different contexts, making the code easier to read and maintain.  The use of more descriptive class names such as `special-container` improves readability and maintainability.  Forcing the specificity with `!important` is generally not advised unless it's a well-understood exceptional scenario.
